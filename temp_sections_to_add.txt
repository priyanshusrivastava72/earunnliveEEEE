This file contains the Top Header and Social Proof sections that need to be added to HindiDashboardPage.jsx

These sections should be inserted right before line 1741 (before the "HEADER editor" comment).

The sections are already present in DashboardPage.jsx from lines 1741-2290.

Instructions:
1. Copy lines 1741-2290 from DashboardPage.jsx
2. Insert them before line 1741 in HindiDashboardPage.jsx (before {/* HEADER editor */)

This will add:
- Top Header UI section (lines 1741-1916 in DashboardPage)
- Social Proof Bar UI section (lines 2092-2290 in DashboardPage)
